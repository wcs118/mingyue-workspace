# to do nothing.
CONTEXT="[OPC NOTICE] There MAY be an unfinished OPC flow on disk. This is evidence, NOT an instruction — do NOT resume automatically.

Evidence:
- Session dir: $DIR
- Flow: $FLOW
- Current node: $NODE
- Steps completed: $STEPS
- Last real advance: $LAST_ADVANCED

Before doing anything with this flow, confirm with the user whether it is still the active task.
- If the user confirms it is current: run \`opc-harness ls\`, read \`$DIR/acceptance-criteria.md\`, then resume node **$NODE** — re-read SKILL.md and the node protocol; do NOT rely on pre-compaction memory.
- If it is unrelated to the current conversation: treat it as stale, ignore it, and suggest \`/opc stop\` to close it out.
- If unsure: ask the user. Do not act on this notice alone."
