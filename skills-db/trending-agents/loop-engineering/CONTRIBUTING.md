# Contributing to Loop Engineering

This repo is a **practical engineering reference**, not a hype collection. We welcome patterns, stories, tool mappings, and honest failure reports.

**Maintainer response:** docs, stories, adopters, and small tests get a first response within **48 hours** (same-day when possible). Comment *I'll take this* on a [`good first issue`](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get assigned.

## Ways to Contribute

| Contribution | Where |
|--------------|-------|
| New loop pattern | `patterns/` + `patterns/registry.yaml` |
| Production story | `stories/` |
| Tool example | `examples/{grok,claude-code,codex,openclaw,opencode,github-actions}/` |
| Skill template | `templates/` |
| Starter kit | `starters/` |
| Doc improvement | `docs/` |

## Contribution Ladder

Start small — every merged PR counts.

| Step | Time | What to contribute |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **1** | ~15 min | Typo fix, adopters row, primitives-matrix row, or `examples/README.md` link |
| **2** | ~1 hr | Production story in `stories/` or tool example in `examples/{tool}/` |
| **3** | Half day | New starter, skill template, or MCP cookbook entry |
| **4** | Full day | Full pattern in `patterns/` + `patterns/registry.yaml` entry |

**Fastest paths:** [Help wanted (README)](./README.md#help-wanted) · [Add Adopter](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/issues/new?template=add-adopter.yml) · [Share a story](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/issues/new?template=share-story.yml) · [open `good first issue` backlog](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

## Pattern Requirements

Every new pattern must include all sections from [templates/pattern-template.md](./templates/pattern-template.md):

1. Goal (one sentence)
2. Scheduling (per-tool commands)
3. Required skills
4. State schema (with example)
5. Typical cycle (numbered steps)
6. Verification strategy (maker/checker)
7. Human handoff points
8. Tool-specific notes (at least 2 tools)
9. Failure modes table
10. Success metrics

Also add an entry to `patterns/registry.yaml`.

## Story Requirements

- Real experience (anonymize if needed)
- Name the pattern used
- Include at least one failure or surprise
- Actionable lesson in one paragraph

## Contributor paths (pick one)

| Path | When | Setup |
|------|------|--------|
| **A — Content** | Stories, examples, adopters, most docs | No install — edit markdown, open PR |
| **B — One package** | Fix a single CLI under `tools/<pkg>` | `cd tools/<pkg> && npm ci && npm test` |
| **C — Full monorepo** | Registry / cross-package scripts | Root `npm ci` then commands below |

Stories and adopters get **same-day review** when possible. Live backlog: [`good first issue`](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Development Setup (Path C)

```bash
npm ci   # at repo root – installs yaml/ajv for scripts/validate-registry.mjs
npm run validate:registry
npm run check:loop-init
```

## Maintainer Response (Adopters & Stories)

PRs that only touch `stories/`, `docs/adopters.md`, or the [Add Adopter](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering/issues/new?template=add-adopter.yml) template get **same-day review** when possible:

1. Maintainer merges or requests one small fix within 24 hours
2. Public thank-you on the PR or issue (`@mention` the contributor)
3. Optional follow-up issue if the contributor wants a second PR (e.g. expand story → pattern example)

Automation posts a welcome comment on new story/adopter PRs (see `.github/workflows/welcome-contributors.yml`).
