# Primitives Matrix — Grok, Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Opencode, Cursor, Windsurf, Hermes

Tool-agnostic loop design: the **capability** is what matters, not the product name. This matrix maps each primitive to how it appears in eight major agent environments.

| Primitive | Job in the Loop | Grok Build TUI | Claude Code | Codex | OpenClaw | Opencode | Cursor | Windsurf | Hermes |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-------|----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Automations / Scheduling** | Discovery + triage on a cadence | `/loop [interval] <prompt>`, `scheduler_create` / `scheduler_list` / `scheduler_delete` (`recurring`, `durable`, `fireImmediately`), `monitor` for streaming events | `/loop`, scheduled tasks, cron, hooks, GitHub Actions | [Automations tab](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/automations): project, prompt, cadence, environment; Triage inbox | [`openclaw cron`](https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/cron-jobs) (`--cron` / `--every` / `--at`, isolated or main session); webhooks (`POST /hooks/agent`, `/hooks/wake`); heartbeat | OS cron / systemd timer / GitHub Action invokes `opencode run "..."`; headless server via `opencode serve` | Cloud Agents + **Automations** (cron, webhooks, Linear/GitHub/Slack triggers); foreground Agent chat for ad-hoc `/loop`-style prompts | Cascade **Workflows** (`/workflow-name`, manual invoke); pair with GitHub Actions or external cron for true scheduling | [`hermes cron create "<cron>" --skill … --deliver local\|origin\|<channel>\|platform:chat_id:thread_id --workdir "$PWD"`](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs); webhooks via `POST /hooks/agent`; per-job `context_from` chains upstream job stdout into downstream prompt |
| **Run-until-done** | Keep working until a verifiable condition holds | [`/goal`](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/goal-engineering) + `update_goal` — persistent objective across turns ([Goal Engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/goal-engineering)) | `/goal` — separate model checks completion | `/goal` — pause/resume, verifiable stop condition | Recurring isolated cron with explicit stop condition in `--message`; delegate via `coding-agent` skill to external CLI; hand off bounded work to Goal Engineering | Bounded `opencode run "<goal + stop condition>"` sessions; follow with verifier agent via `--agent verifier` | Agent mode + **hooks** (`.cursor/hooks.json`) for grind-until-green loops | Workflow steps with explicit verification checkpoints; **Memories** for cross-session continuity | Chained cron jobs via `hermes cron edit --context-from <upstream-id>`; skill loops using `delegate_task` until a verifiable stop condition holds; `hermes cron edit --schedule` adjusts cadence live |
| **Worktrees** | Safe parallel execution | Subagents with `isolation: "worktree"`, background tasks | `git worktree`, `--worktree`, `isolation: worktree` on subagents | Built-in worktree per thread | `exec` + `git worktree` in agent workspace; `coding-agent` delegates to CLI backends; optional sandbox per agent | Explicit `git worktree` per implementer run; pass worktree path with `--dir` | Git worktree per Composer / Cloud Agent task | Workspace isolation; multiple simultaneous Cascade sessions | Standard `git worktree` inside the cron job; `--workdir` pins tool cwd + injects `AGENTS.md` per job so parallel jobs cannot collide |
| **Skills** | Persistent project knowledge | `SKILL.md` in `.grok/skills/` or `~/.grok/skills/`; invoked by name | `SKILL.md` in `.claude/skills/` or project skills | [Agent Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) — `$name` or implicit match | `SKILL.md` in `<workspace>/skills/`, `.agents/skills`, or `~/.openclaw/skills`; [AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io) spec; [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) + `openclaw skills install` | `SKILL.md` in `skills/<name>/`; `AGENTS.md` for always-on repo rules | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (globs, `alwaysApply`), `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/skills/` | `.devin/rules/` or `.windsurf/rules/` (persistent context); `.windsurf/workflows/` (reusable recipes) | `SKILL.md` under `~/.hermes/skills/<name>/` (user) or `.hermes/skills/<name>/` (project); `hermes skills install/list/inspect`; invoked via `--skill <name>` on cron jobs, or auto-loaded by description match |
| **Plugins & Connectors** | Reach into real tools | MCP servers via `CallMcpTool` | MCP servers + plugins | Connectors (MCP) + plugins for distribution | MCP + channel plugins (Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.); browser automation plugin | MCP servers in `opencode.json`; GitHub/Linear/Slack via CLI or MCP bridge | MCP in settings; Cloud Agent sandbox with full connector access | MCP via Cascade settings / `mcp_config.json` | MCP servers via `hermes mcp add`; built-in home channels (Feishu, Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS); `hermes send` delivers to any connected channel |
| **Sub-agents** | Maker / checker split | `Task` tool with `subagent_type`, worktree isolation | Task subagents in `.claude/agents/`, agent teams | Subagents as TOML in `.codex/agents/` | `agents.list` multi-agent routing; isolated cron subagent orchestration; separate verifier agent id | Named agents via `opencode agent`; invoke one role per run with `--agent verifier` or `--agent implementer` | Multi-agent mode, review mode, custom agents in `.cursor/agents/` | Multiple Cascades in parallel; workflow-orchestrated implementer → reviewer steps | `delegate_task(goal=..., role='leaf'\|'orchestrator', toolsets=[...])` — background execution, isolated context, result re-enters as a new message; up to N children in parallel per `delegation.max_concurrent_children` |
| **State / Memory** | Track what's done across runs | `STATE.md`, todos, durable scheduler state | `AGENTS.md`, progress files, Linear via MCP | Markdown or Linear via connector | `STATE.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md` in workspace; cron persisted in Gateway SQLite; Skill Workshop for skill proposals | `STATE.md`, `LOOP.md`, `AGENTS.md`, session export via `opencode export <sessionID>` | `STATE.md`, `LOOP.md`, Cloud Agent memories | `STATE.md`, Cascade **Memories**, workflow run notes | `STATE.md` in `--workdir`; `HEARTBEAT.md` for periodic polls; persistent facts via `hermes memory` (survive across sessions); cron jobs stored in gateway SQLite |

**Reference MCP server:** this repo ships [`tools/mcp-server/`](../tools/mcp-server/) — patterns, skills, state, budget, and safety docs as runtime-queryable MCP resources (reduces prompt stuffing). Config example: [`examples/mcp/loop-engineering.mcp.json`](../examples/mcp/loop-engineering.mcp.json).

## Scheduling Quick Reference

| Use case | Grok | Claude Code | Codex | OpenClaw | Opencode | Cursor | Windsurf | Hermes |
|----------|------|-------------|-------|----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Every 5 minutes | `/loop 5m <prompt>` | `/loop 5m <prompt>` | Automation, 5m cadence | `openclaw cron create "*/5 * * * *" --session isolated --message "..."` | Cron/systemd calls `opencode run "..."` | Automation cron trigger | External cron + `/workflow` or Action | `hermes cron create "*/5 * * * *" --deliver local --skill loop-triage "..."` |
| Daily morning | `/loop 1d <prompt>` | Cron / `/loop 1d` | Automation, daily | `openclaw cron create "0 7 * * *" --tz ... --session isolated` + optional `--announce` | Cron/systemd calls `opencode run "Run loop-triage"` | Automation daily + `AGENTS.md` context | Daily workflow + Memories | `hermes cron create "0 7 * * *" --name "Daily triage" --deliver local --skill loop-triage --workdir "$PWD" "..."` |
| Until tests pass | [`/goal`](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/goal-engineering/blob/main/patterns/tests-green.md) + `goal-verifier` skill (or loop + verifier) | `/goal all tests pass` | `/goal` | Isolated cron + verifier in message, or `coding-agent` + external CLI | `opencode run "Goal: all tests pass. Stop when verifier approves."` | Hooks grind-until-green | Workflow with test/fix loop | Bounded skill loop using `delegate_task` for the maker + a second `delegate_task` as checker; or chained cron jobs with `context_from` |
| Survive restart | `scheduler_create` with `durable: true` | Hooks + persisted config | Automation (server-side) | Cron jobs persist in Gateway SQLite | systemd timer + committed `STATE.md` + exported sessions | Cloud Agent + repo-persisted state | Memories + committed `STATE.md` | Cron jobs persist in gateway SQLite; `--workdir` re-injects project context on every tick |
| Event-driven (CI fail) | `monitor` or GitHub Action | GitHub Action + webhook | Automation + webhook | `POST /hooks/agent` or mapped webhooks | GitHub Action / webhook bridge calls `opencode run` | Automation on PR/issue events | GitHub Action triggers + `/workflow` | `POST /hooks/agent` with `{"message":"…","name":"…","deliver":"local"}` |

## Skill Packaging

| Concept | Grok | Claude Code | Codex | OpenClaw | Opencode | Cursor | Windsurf | Hermes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Authoring format | `SKILL.md` + optional scripts/references | Same | Same | Same ([AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io)) | Same (`SKILL.md` under `skills/<name>/`) | `SKILL.md` or `.mdc` rules with frontmatter | Markdown rules + workflow files | `SKILL.md` + optional `references/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` ([AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io) spec) |
| Distribution | Copy to `.grok/skills/` or user skills dir | Plugin / copy to project | Plugin bundle | `<workspace>/skills/`, ClawHub, `openclaw skills install` | Copy to `skills/`; keep project rules in `AGENTS.md` | `.cursor/skills/` or `.cursor/rules/` | `.windsurf/rules/` + `.windsurf/workflows/` in repo | `~/.hermes/skills/<name>/` (user) or `.hermes/skills/<name>/` (project); `hermes skills install <name>` from skills.sh, ClawHub, well-known endpoints, GitHub |
| Invocation | Skill name in prompt or auto-match on description | `$skill-name` or implicit | `$skill-name` | Slash command or auto-injected in system prompt | Name the skill in the `opencode run` message, or configure named agents in `opencode.json` | Rules auto-apply by glob; skills on demand | `/workflow-name` or Rules always-on in Cascade | `--skill <name>` on cron jobs; auto-loaded by description match mid-session; `--skills X,Y` on `hermes chat` for one-off preload |

## Sub-agent Patterns

| Split | When to use | Grok | Claude Code | Codex | OpenClaw | Opencode | Cursor | Windsurf | Hermes |
|-------|-------------|------|-------------|-------|----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Implementer → Verifier | Any unattended code change | `Task` + different instructions/model | `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` | TOML agent with higher `reasoning_effort` | Separate `agents.list` id or verifier block in cron message | `opencode run "..." --agent implementer` in worktree, then `opencode run "Verify diff" --agent verifier --file diff.patch` | Review mode or second Cloud Agent pass | Second Cascade or workflow review step | Two sequential `delegate_task` calls (first `role='leaf'` with terminal+file; second `role='leaf'` with review-only toolsets); or two chained cron jobs via `context_from` |
| Explorer → Implementer | Large unfamiliar codebase | `explore` subagent_type | Explorer agent | Fast read-only subagent | `--light-context` cron + follow-up isolated job | First `opencode run "read-only exploration..."`, then follow-up implementer in a worktree | `@codebase` + plan mode first | Audit workflow (read-only) then implement | First `delegate_task(toolsets=['file'], goal='read-only exploration…')`, then follow-up `delegate_task(toolsets=['terminal','file'], goal='implement…')` in a worktree |
| Triage only | Report-first loops | `loop-triage` skill | `$loop-triage` | Automation calls skill | `loop-triage` + isolated cron; restrict `--tools` | `opencode run "Run loop-triage. Do not edit code."` | `AGENTS.md` + report-only rule | Triage workflow, no edit steps | `loop-triage` skill + `hermes cron` with `--deliver local`; restrict skill's tool list; no `delegate_task` in the prompt |

## State Conventions

Recommended filenames (pick one spine per project):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `STATE.md` | General loop memory (daily triage) |
| `issue-triage-state.md` | Issue queue health (feeder for daily triage) |
| `pr-babysitter-state.md` | PR-specific watcher state |
| `ci-sweeper-state.md` | Active CI failures + attempt counts |
| `post-merge-state.md` | Cleanup backlog from recent merges |

Linear / GitHub Projects work equally well — the loop must **read and write** the same store every run.

## Choosing a Tool

You do not need to pick one forever. A well-designed loop transfers:

1. Write the **skill** (tool-agnostic `SKILL.md`)
2. Define the **state schema** (markdown or JSON)
3. Document the **verification split** (who checks whom)
4. Map scheduling to your current TUI, editor, or Action

For opencode, the transfer usually means `skills/`, `STATE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and cron/systemd invoking `opencode run`. See [examples/](../examples/) for the same pattern implemented across tools.

## Copy-paste starters (Daily Triage, L1)

| Tool | Starter |
|------|---------|
| Grok | [starters/minimal-loop](../starters/minimal-loop/) |
| Claude Code | [starters/minimal-loop-claude](../starters/minimal-loop-claude/) |
| Codex | [starters/minimal-loop-codex](../starters/minimal-loop-codex/) |
| OpenClaw | [examples/openclaw/daily-triage.md](../examples/openclaw/daily-triage.md) — copy `skills/` + `STATE.md`; no `loop-init` yet |
| Opencode | [starters/minimal-loop-opencode](../starters/minimal-loop-opencode/) |
| Cursor / Windsurf | Copy `SKILL.md` + `STATE.md` from any starter; map scheduling to editor Automations or Workflows (see appendix) |
| Hermes | [examples/hermes/daily-triage.md](../examples/hermes/daily-triage.md) — copy `starters/minimal-loop/STATE.md.example` to project root; install `loop-triage` skill under `~/.hermes/skills/`; schedule with `hermes cron create`. No `loop-init --tool hermes` yet — this bridge is the current path. |

Audit after copying: `npx @cobusgreyling/loop-audit . --suggest`

Scaffold automatically: `npx @cobusgreyling/loop-init . --pattern daily-triage --tool grok`

## Goals (run-until-done)

Loops discover ongoing work; **goals finish bounded tasks**. Canonical reference: **[Goal Engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/goal-engineering)** (`/goal`, `update_goal`, `GOAL.md`, `goal-verifier`).

| Handoff | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Loop found a fixable item | `/goal Read STATE.md top item. Complete per goal-engineering pattern. goal-verifier before done.` |
| Audit goal readiness | `npx @cobusgreyling/goal-audit . --suggest` |
| Goal vs loop decision | [goal-vs-loop.md](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/goal-engineering/blob/main/docs/goal-vs-loop.md) |

## Appendix: Editor transfer recipes (Opencode, Cursor & Windsurf)

Transfer recipes map the same loop shape onto each host:

| Step | Opencode | Cursor | Windsurf |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| 1. Skills | Copy `templates/SKILL.md.loop-triage` → `skills/loop-triage/SKILL.md`; add always-on rules in `AGENTS.md` | Copy `templates/SKILL.md.loop-triage` → `.cursor/skills/loop-triage/SKILL.md`; add always-on triage rules in `.cursor/rules/` | Copy skill content into `.windsurf/rules/loop-triage.md` |
| 2. State | `cp starters/minimal-loop-opencode/STATE.md.example STATE.md` | `cp starters/minimal-loop/STATE.md.example STATE.md` | Same — commit `STATE.md` at repo root |
| 3. Scheduling | Cron/systemd calls `opencode run "Run loop-triage"`; use `--session` / `--continue` for continuity | Cloud Automation (cron) or manual Agent prompt on cadence | Create `.windsurf/workflows/daily-triage.md`, invoke `/daily-triage` |
| 4. Verification | Create a verifier named agent with `opencode agent`; invoke via `opencode run "Verify diff" --agent verifier --file diff.patch` | `.cursor/agents/loop-verifier.md` from `templates/SKILL.md.verifier` | Add review step at end of workflow; human gate on denylist paths |
| 5. Connectors | Configure MCP or CLI bridges in `opencode.json` | Enable GitHub MCP read-only for issue/PR discovery | Configure GitHub MCP in Cascade settings |

## Appendix: Codeium (Windsurf)

Codeium rebranded its agentic surface to Windsurf; the agent itself is called
Cascade. There is no standalone Codeium CLI — "Codeium" as a brand today
mostly covers enterprise completion analytics, not agent loop primitives.
This appendix documents the **Windsurf IDE / Cascade agent**, the same
surface referenced in the Editor transfer recipes table above.

| Primitive | Windsurf (Cascade) mapping |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Scheduling | No native cron-style scheduler. Use `.windsurf/workflows/<name>.md` invoked manually via `/workflow-name`, or pair with an external scheduler (cron, systemd, GitHub Actions) that reopens the workspace and triggers a workflow. |
| Skills / Rules path | Project rules: `.windsurfrules` (root) or `.windsurf/rules/` for multiple files. Global rules across all projects: `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md`. |
| State | No native `STATE.md` convention. Commit `STATE.md` at the repo root manually, same as other editor-hosted tools; Cascade's built-in Memories system (per-workspace) can supplement but does not replace a committed state file. |
| Maker/checker split | No native subagent or reviewer role. Workaround: run the maker in one Cascade session, then open a second session (or manually review the diff view) as the checker before accepting changes. |
| Worktrees | Not native. Use standard git branches/worktrees and review through Cascade's diff view before merge, same as Aider. |
| Connectors | Configure MCP servers directly in Cascade/Windsurf settings for GitHub, issue/PR discovery, or other external context. |
| Honest gaps | No durable scheduler for headless/unattended runs, no built-in maker/checker separation, no first-class state-file convention — Windsurf's loop primitives are almost entirely manual and session-driven today. |

Minimal transfer recipe:

```bash
mkdir -p .windsurf/rules .windsurf/workflows
cp templates/SKILL.md.loop-triage .windsurf/rules/loop-triage.md
cp starters/minimal-loop/STATE.md.example STATE.md
```

Week-one Daily Triage workflow (`.windsurf/workflows/daily-triage.md`), report-only:

```text
Run loop-triage for this repository.

Read STATE.md first.
Update STATE.md with High Priority and Watch List only.
Do not edit source code in week one.
```

Invoke with `/daily-triage` in the Cascade panel.

Verifier pass for later L2 work — open a second Cascade session:

```text
Act as loop-verifier.

Review the current git diff against STATE.md goals.
Report PASS/FAIL and do not edit files.
```

After copying: map scheduling to manual `/workflow-name` invocation or an external
scheduler until Windsurf has a first-class cron-equivalent. Use `.windsurfrules`
or `.windsurf/rules/` for always-on repo guidance, and a second Cascade session
(or human diff review) for maker/checker separation.

## Appendix: Aider CLI

Aider is CLI-first rather than a loop host with native schedulers, so map the same primitives from [Choosing a Tool](#choosing-a-tool) onto shell scripts, cron, and git branches.

| Primitive | Aider mapping |
|-----------|---------------|
| Scheduling | Run one-shot scripted sessions from cron/systemd/GitHub Actions with `aider --message` or `aider --message-file`, or use `--watch-files` for comment-triggered work. |
| Skills | Load loop instructions as read-only context with `--read templates/SKILL.md.loop-triage` or a project-specific conventions file. |
| State | Keep `STATE.md` at the repo root and pass it as the editable file for triage loops; use pattern-specific state files such as `pr-babysitter-state.md` for specialized loops. |
| Maker/checker split | Run the implementer in one Aider session/branch, then run a second read-only reviewer session over `git diff` or `diff.patch` before any commit/PR. |
| Connectors | Prefer CLI tools or MCP sidecars called from scripts; keep credentials out of prompts and state files. |

Week-one Daily Triage command (report-only, state updates only):

```bash
aider STATE.md \
  --read templates/SKILL.md.loop-triage \
  --no-auto-commits \
  --no-dirty-commits \
  --message "Run loop-triage. Update STATE.md with High Priority and Watch List only. Do not edit source code in week one."
```

Verifier pass for later L2 work:

```bash
git diff > diff.patch
aider --read diff.patch --read STATE.md \
  --no-auto-commits \
  --no-dirty-commits \
  --message "Act as loop-verifier. Review the diff against STATE.md goals. Report PASS/FAIL and do not edit files."
```

Transfer recipe: copy the tool-agnostic `SKILL.md` + state schema from this repo; map scheduling to cron, systemd, or CI until Aider is wrapped by a richer loop scheduler.

## Appendix: Roo Code

> **Lifecycle note:** Roo Code [shut down its VS Code extension, Cloud, and
> Router on May 15, 2026](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/a676c4173ae60348095efaebfd1292a9617622c0/docs/sunset.md),
> and the [extension repository is archived](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code).
> Treat this mapping as migration guidance for an already-vetted local build,
> not as a recommendation to start a new unattended loop on discontinued
> services.

| Primitive | Roo Code mapping |
|-----------|------------------|
| Scheduling | The documented extension surface is an attended VS Code task; it has no documented first-class durable scheduler. Collect evidence with cron or CI outside Roo, then hand that snapshot to an attended task. Do not assume an external timer can launch extension tasks or that Roo Cloud runs remain available. |
| Skills | The archived extension discovers project skills from [`.roo/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/a676c4173ae60348095efaebfd1292a9617622c0/docs/features/skills.mdx), with mode-specific variants when needed. Keep the portable loop contract in the cross-agent path unless Roo-specific behavior is required. |
| State | Commit `STATE.md` for the queue, evidence, and decisions that must survive machines or tool migration. Roo's task todo lists are conversation state, while [checkpoints are task-scoped snapshots in a shadow Git repository](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/a676c4173ae60348095efaebfd1292a9617622c0/docs/features/checkpoints.mdx); neither replaces shared repository state. |
| Maker / checker split | Use a write-capable maker mode and a fresh, read-only checker mode. [Custom modes restrict tool groups and editable paths](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/a676c4173ae60348095efaebfd1292a9617622c0/docs/features/custom-modes.mdx), and [Boomerang subtasks isolate conversation context](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/a676c4173ae60348095efaebfd1292a9617622c0/docs/features/boomerang-tasks.mdx), but subtasks still share workspace and extension configuration. Treat this as workflow separation, not a security boundary or independent verification by itself. |
| Connectors / MCP | Project servers live in [`.roo/mcp.json`; global servers live in `mcp_settings.json`](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/a676c4173ae60348095efaebfd1292a9617622c0/docs/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-roo.mdx), and project entries win on name collisions. Roo ships no MCP servers. Keep MCP disabled for week-one triage; later, avoid `alwaysAllow`, disable unused tools, and keep credentials in environment-backed secrets rather than prompts or `STATE.md`. |

### Week-one Daily Triage (report-only)

Use an attended task in a custom mode whose only tool group is `read`. Keep
auto-approval off and MCP disabled. Collect `git status --short` and
`git diff --stat` yourself, paste their output as untrusted evidence, and then
use this prompt:

```text
Run a Daily Triage for this repository.
Read AGENTS.md, STATE.md if present, and the relevant repository documentation.
Use the pasted git status and diff summary as evidence; do not execute commands.
Report High Priority items, Watch List items, and evidence for every finding.
Return Markdown in chat only.
Do not edit files, use MCP, create subtasks, apply fixes, commit, push, or open PRs.
If a write or external action is needed, stop and describe the proposal for review.
```

This leaves the repository untouched; a human decides whether to copy any
finding into durable state or promote it to implementation.

> **Human gate (L2+):** before enabling edits, commands, MCP, or subtasks, a
> person must approve the selected issue, allowed paths, validation plan, and
> final diff. Give the checker a human-produced diff in a fresh read-only task,
> and require another human decision before commit, push, or merge.

### Honest gaps

- Roo Code is discontinued and its official extension source is archived, so
  there are no supported Cloud/Router runs or future security fixes to assume.
- The archived extension has no documented durable scheduler or portable
  `STATE.md` convention; task todos and checkpoints remain task-local aids.
- Modes and Boomerang subtasks separate instructions and conversation context,
  not processes, worktrees, credentials, or the shared workspace.
- A report-only prompt is not a permission boundary. Use read-only tool groups
  and keep [auto-approval](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/a676c4173ae60348095efaebfd1292a9617622c0/docs/features/auto-approving-actions.mdx)
  and MCP disabled for the first week.

## Appendix: Continue.dev

Continue is available in VS Code and as the `cn` CLI. For loop work, the CLI's
[headless mode](https://docs.continue.dev/cli/headless-mode) is the portable
surface: it runs one prompt to completion and prints the final response, while
the IDE extension is better suited to attended Agent or Plan sessions.

| Primitive | Continue.dev mapping |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Scheduling | Continue has no first-class durable scheduler. Use cron, a systemd timer, or GitHub Actions to invoke `cn -p "..."`; keep the prompt, config, and state file in the repository so every run starts from the same contract. |
| Run-until-done | `cn -p "<bounded goal and stop condition>"` runs a single headless task to completion. Use explicit validation in the prompt and a separate verifier run; Continue does not provide a durable `/goal`-style objective that survives arbitrary restarts. |
| Skills | Put always-on project guidance in [`.continue/rules/`](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/rules), or load a rule/agent at launch with `--rule` / `--agent`. A repository `AGENTS.md` can hold the portable instructions, but Continue Rules are the native reusable guidance primitive rather than `SKILL.md`. |
| Worktrees | No built-in worktree isolation. Create a standard `git worktree` per task, start one `cn` process in each worktree, and review each branch independently. |
| Sub-agents / maker-checker | Continue does not expose a native sub-agent team or dedicated verifier role. Run the maker and checker as separate `cn` sessions (preferably in separate worktrees); give the checker read-only permissions and the current diff. TUI `/fork` forks conversation history, not an isolated coding worker. |
| State / memory | `cn --resume` restores a previous session, but portable loop state should live in a committed `STATE.md` that every scheduled prompt reads. Use session history for convenience, not as the only durable queue or audit trail. |
| Plugins / MCP | Configure MCP servers in `config.yaml` / `.continue/mcpServers`, attach one with `--mcp`, and restrict tools with [`--allow`, `--ask`, and `--exclude`](https://docs.continue.dev/cli/tool-permissions). Keep credentials in environment-backed secrets, never in prompts or `STATE.md`. |
| Honest gaps | No native cron scheduler, durable cross-run goal, automatic worktree isolation, first-class sub-agents, or built-in state-file convention. Continue's [upstream repository is read-only after its final 2.0.0 release](https://docs.continue.dev/), so pin the version and validate any external automation around it. |

Week-one Daily Triage, report-only:

```bash
cn -p --readonly --silent "
Run a Daily Triage for this repository.
Read AGENTS.md and STATE.md if they exist, inspect the current git status and diff,
and report High Priority items, Watch List items, and evidence for each finding.
Do not edit files, run fixes, commit, push, or open issues or pull requests.
" > continue-daily-triage-report.md
```

The shell writes only the report artifact; Continue remains in read-only mode.
Review the report before promoting any item to implementation.

> **Human gate (L2+):** a person must approve the selected issue, allowed paths,
> validation plan, and final diff before enabling write tools or opening a PR.
> Keep secrets, authentication, billing, deployment, and destructive data paths
> behind explicit per-run approval, and use a separate read-only checker session.

For an L2 maker/checker handoff, run the maker in a dedicated worktree with only
the minimum required write permissions. Then start a fresh `cn --readonly`
session in that worktree and ask it to review `git diff`, `STATE.md`, and the
issue acceptance criteria without editing files.

## Appendix: Cline

Cline spans editor extensions and a headless CLI/SDK. The loop primitives differ
by surface: durable schedules and persistent agent teams are available in the
CLI, SDK, and Kanban, while VS Code and JetBrains remain attended editor
sessions for those capabilities.

| Primitive | Cline mapping |
|-----------|---------------|
| Scheduling | The CLI has a first-class, hub-backed scheduler: [`cline schedule create`](https://docs.cline.bot/cli/scheduling) stores cron jobs that survive process restarts and run independently of a terminal. This is not currently available in the VS Code or JetBrains extensions; use the CLI/SDK scheduler or an external cron/Action for those surfaces. |
| Skills / rules | Put on-demand `SKILL.md` packages in [`.cline/skills/<name>/`](https://docs.cline.bot/customization/skills) (workspace) or `~/.cline/skills/` (global). Put always-on project instructions in [`.clinerules/`](https://docs.cline.bot/customization/cline-rules); Cline also detects `AGENTS.md`. |
| State | Cline persists sessions, schedule runs, and CLI/SDK team state, but it has no native `STATE.md` convention. Commit `STATE.md` at the repo root and make every scheduled prompt read the same file when the state must be portable, reviewable, and shared across tools. Cline team state under `~/.cline/data/teams/<team-name>/` supplements rather than replaces repository state. |
| Maker / checker split | [Agent teams](https://docs.cline.bot/cli/agent-teams) provide a coordinator, specialists, and a persistent task board in CLI/SDK/Kanban; [experimental subagents](https://docs.cline.bot/features/subagents) can handle bounded research. For an independent checker, use a second approval-gated Plan session or a separately restricted SDK agent over the maker's diff—team membership alone does not enforce verifier independence. |
| MCP | Configure and inspect servers with [`cline mcp`](https://docs.cline.bot/cli/cli-reference); CLI MCP settings live in `~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`. Keep MCP tools disabled or approval-gated for week-one triage, and never put credentials in prompts, rules, or `STATE.md`. |
| Honest gaps | No first-class `STATE.md`; schedules and persistent teams are not available in the editor extensions; CLI team state is machine-local; and Cline's CLI can auto-approve tools, so a report-only prompt is not a substitute for an explicit permission boundary. |

Week-one Daily Triage, report-only:

```bash
cline --plan --auto-approve false --json --cwd "$PWD" \
  "Run a Daily Triage for this repository.
Read AGENTS.md and STATE.md if present.
Inspect repository state and report High Priority items, Watch List items,
and evidence for each finding.
Do not edit files, run fixes, commit, push, or write through MCP tools.
If any required action would write, stop and report the proposed action." \
  > cline-daily-triage-report.jsonl
```

This writes the one-shot Plan session's CLI event stream to the report artifact.
Automatic tool approval is disabled, so review each request and deny any write
before turning the prompt into a durable schedule.

> **Human gate (L2+):** approve the selected issue, allowed paths, command/MCP
> policy, and final diff before enabling edits or unattended runs. Run the
> checker with write tools disabled or approval-gated; never treat a teammate's
> self-review as independent verification.

## Appendix: Zed

Zed is editor-hosted rather than a standalone loop scheduler, so map the same primitives from [Choosing a Tool](#choosing-a-tool) onto [Agent Panel](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/agent-panel) threads, [Instructions](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/instructions), [Skills](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/skills), [Agent Profiles](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/agent-profiles), [Tool Permissions](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/tool-permissions), [MCP](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/mcp) servers, [Terminal Threads](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/terminal-threads), [Tasks](https://zed.dev/docs/tasks), and [Parallel Agents](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/parallel-agents) worktrees.

| Primitive | Zed mapping |
|-----------|-------------|
| Scheduling | Zed does not currently expose a first-class cron-style loop scheduler. Use Agent Panel threads or Terminal Threads for manual/ad-hoc runs, Zed Tasks for editor-side command hooks, and cron, systemd, GitHub Actions, or another external scheduler for cadence. |
| Project rules / skills path | Put always-on repo guidance in project instructions, preferably `AGENTS.md`; Zed also supports `.rules`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`. Put reusable workflows in project-local Skills under `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. |
| State | Keep `STATE.md` at the repo root and make every loop prompt read and update the same file. Zed thread history helps local continuity, but committed markdown state is the portable memory spine across restarts, agents, and external schedulers. |
| Worktrees | Use Parallel Agents with git worktree isolation when multiple threads may edit the same files; review the diff and merge through normal git flow. |
| Maker/checker split | Run the maker in a Write profile thread, then run a second Ask/read-only or restricted custom profile thread over `git diff`, `STATE.md`, and the acceptance criteria. Use Tool Permissions to keep destructive tools denied or confirmation-gated for the checker. |
| Connectors | Configure MCP servers in Zed Agent Settings for GitHub, docs lookup, issue/PR discovery, or other external context. External Agents and Terminal Threads may use their own native config, so do not assume Zed controls every connector. Keep credentials out of prompts and state files. |

Minimal transfer recipe:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills/loop-triage .agents/skills/loop-verifier
cp templates/SKILL.md.loop-triage .agents/skills/loop-triage/SKILL.md
cp templates/SKILL.md.verifier .agents/skills/loop-verifier/SKILL.md
cp starters/minimal-loop/STATE.md.example STATE.md
```

Week-one Daily Triage prompt (report-only, state updates only):

```text
Run loop-triage for this repository.

Read AGENTS.md and STATE.md first.
Update STATE.md with High Priority and Watch List only.
Do not edit source code in week one.
Use MCP tools only when needed for issue/PR discovery.
```

Verifier pass for later L2 work:

```text
Act as loop-verifier.

Review git diff against STATE.md goals and the issue acceptance criteria.
Use an Ask/read-only or confirmation-gated profile.
Report PASS/FAIL and do not edit files.
```

After copying: map scheduling to manual Agent Panel threads, Terminal Threads, Zed Tasks, or an external scheduler until Zed has a richer first-class loop scheduler. Use `AGENTS.md` for always-on repo rules, `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for reusable workflows, Agent Profiles / Tool Permissions for maker-checker separation, and MCP for external tools.

## Appendix: Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI is a terminal-based agent tool. Map the same loop primitives onto the `gemini` command, external schedulers, context files, and separate verification sessions.

| Primitive | Gemini CLI mapping |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Scheduling | Use external schedulers such as cron, systemd timers, or GitHub Actions to invoke Gemini CLI workflows on a cadence. |
| Skills / Context Files | Use project context files such as `GEMINI.md` and repository documentation to provide instructions, conventions, and background information. |
| State | Keep persistent loop state in files such as `STATE.md.example`. Each run should read existing state, update only relevant sections, and preserve history. |
| Maker/checker split | Use separate Gemini CLI sessions: one session creates changes, another reviews output, validates requirements, and checks the diff. |
| Connectors | Use available MCP servers or external tools to provide additional context and capabilities. |

### Week-one Daily Triage Example

A Gemini CLI daily triage loop:

1. Start Gemini CLI from the repository root.
2. Read `STATE.md.example`.
3. Review pending triage items.
4. Update only triage sections.
5. Do not edit source files during the first week.
6. Save updated state for the next run.

## Appendix: GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot spans an interactive CLI and a cloud coding agent. Keep the
loop's durable state in the repository, use PRs as the cloud agent's write
boundary, and retain a human merge gate.

| Primitive | GitHub Copilot mapping |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Automations / Scheduling | In an interactive Copilot CLI session, experimental [`/every` and `/after`](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/automate-copilot-cli/schedule-prompts) schedule recurring or delayed prompts; `/loop` aliases `/every`. These schedules run only while that session is active. Use cron, Task Scheduler, or GitHub Actions with `copilot -p` for unattended cadence. |
| Skills | Put project skills in `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `.agents/skills/`, or `.claude/skills/`; personal skills live in `~/.copilot/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/`. See [Adding agent skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/add-skills). Use `.github/agents/*.md` for specialist custom agents. |
| State | Commit `STATE.md` as the portable source of truth. Session history or Copilot memory may supplement it, but every scheduled run should read and update the same repository file. |
| Worktrees / isolation | Copilot CLI can create a worktree with `/worktree`. The cloud agent performs its task in an isolated sandbox and returns changes on a pull request branch; use one task/branch per independent change. |
| Verification split | Let Copilot create the draft PR, then run CI and have a human review the diff. A separate Copilot code review can add comments, but it does not replace required human approval. By default, a user with write access must approve GitHub Actions runs on cloud-agent PRs. |
| Connectors | Configure MCP servers and repository tools with the least privilege needed for discovery or validation. Do not grant write tools to the week-one report-only loop. |
| Honest gaps | CLI schedules are not durable after the interactive session closes. Cloud-agent writes are PR-oriented, its internet access is restricted, workflow runs may await approval, and the agent cannot approve or merge its own pull request. |

### Week-one Daily Triage (report-only)

```text
Run Daily Triage for this repository.

1. Read AGENTS.md (if present) and STATE.md before doing anything else.
2. Inspect open issues and pull requests for High Priority and Watch List items.
3. Update only the High Priority and Watch List sections of STATE.md.
4. Do not edit source code, workflow files, issue content, or pull requests.
5. Report what changed and any item that needs a human decision.
```

For later code-changing levels, assign bounded work to the cloud agent and
review the resulting draft PR. Follow GitHub's guidance to
[review Copilot output](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/use-copilot-agents/review-copilot-output):
inspect the diff, approve workflow execution only after reviewing workflow
changes, request revisions as needed, and merge only after a human checker is
satisfied. Never enable auto-merge as a substitute for this gate.

## Appendix: Amazon Q Developer CLI

Amazon Q Developer CLI (`q chat`) is a terminal-based agent, AWS-native, with custom agent
profiles and MCP support. Map the same loop primitives onto `q chat`, custom agent configs,
context resources, and external schedulers.

| Primitive | Amazon Q Developer CLI mapping |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Scheduling | No native cron-style scheduler. Use external schedulers (cron, systemd timers, GitHub Actions) to invoke `q chat` non-interactively, or `q chat --resume` to continue a saved per-directory conversation on the next scheduled run. |
| Rules / Context files | Define a custom agent in `.amazonq/agents/<name>.json` (project) or `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/<name>.json` (personal), and list always-on context in its `resources` field (e.g. `file://STATE.md`, `file://.amazonq/rules/**/*.md`). Use `hooks.agentSpawn` to inject fresh context (like `git status`) at session start. |
| State | Keep `STATE.md` at the repo root, referenced in the custom agent's `resources` field so it's loaded every session; each run should read then update only the relevant section. |
| Maker/checker split | No native subagent/reviewer primitive. Workaround: define two custom agents (e.g. `daily-triage.json` with write tools, `loop-verifier.json` restricted to `fs_read`/`@git` only) and run the verifier agent over the diff in a separate `q chat --agent loop-verifier` session. |
| Connectors | Configure MCP servers in `.amazonq/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json` (global); scope tool trust per agent via `allowedTools`. Treat workspace `.amazonq/mcp.json` files from untrusted repos with caution — review before opening, since auto-loaded MCP configs have been a real attack vector for this class of tool. |
| Honest gaps | No first-class scheduler, no built-in maker/checker separation, no dedicated state-file convention — these are all manual conventions layered on top of `q chat`, same as most terminal agents without a purpose-built loop scheduler. |

Minimal transfer recipe:

```bash
mkdir -p .amazonq/agents .amazonq/rules
cp templates/SKILL.md.loop-triage .amazonq/rules/loop-triage.md
cp starters/minimal-loop/STATE.md.example STATE.md
```

`.amazonq/agents/daily-triage.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "daily-triage",
  "description": "Report-only daily triage agent",
  "prompt": "Run loop-triage. Update STATE.md with High Priority and Watch List only. Do not edit source code in week one.",
  "tools": ["fs_read", "fs_write"],
  "resources": [
    "file://STATE.md",
    "file://.amazonq/rules/loop-triage.md"
  ]
}
```

### Week-one Daily Triage prompt (report-only, copy-paste)

```bash
q chat --agent daily-triage --no-interactive \
  "Run loop-triage. Read STATE.md first. Update only High Priority and Watch List sections. Do not edit source code in week one."
```

Verifier pass for later L2 work — a separate, read-only-scoped agent:

```bash
git diff > diff.patch
q chat --agent loop-verifier --no-interactive \
  "Act as loop-verifier. Review diff.patch against STATE.md goals. Report PASS/FAIL and do not edit files."
```

After copying: map scheduling to cron/systemd/GitHub Actions until Q has a first-class
loop scheduler. Use `.amazonq/rules/` for always-on repo guidance, separate custom agents
for maker/checker separation, and `.amazonq/mcp.json` for external tools.

## Appendix: Devin (Cognition)

Devin is a cloud-hosted autonomous AI software engineer. Map loop primitives onto its
Scheduled Sessions, Playbooks, Connectors, Managed Devins, and Knowledge base.

| Primitive | Devin mapping |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Scheduling** | **Scheduled Sessions** (`Settings → Schedules`): create recurring or one-time sessions (e.g., daily 07:00 UTC). For cron syntax, invoke the [Devin API](https://docs.devin.ai/api-reference/overview) (`POST /sessions`) from a GitHub Action or systemd timer. |
| **Run-until-done** | Devin runs until the session goal is satisfied. Pair with Devin Review: Devin opens a PR, CI runs, Devin re-enters on failure and re-pushes until tests pass. |
| **Worktrees** | Each session runs in an **isolated VM** — parallel sessions cannot collide. For multi-branch work, create one session per branch. |
| **Skills** | **Playbooks** (`Settings → Playbooks`): reusable prompt templates (custom system instructions), equivalent to `SKILL.md`. Attach to any session or schedule; author in the web app or extract from successful sessions. |
| **Plugins & Connectors** | **Connectors** (`Settings → Integrations`): GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Teams, Jira, Linear. Enable GitHub/GitLab for PR writes; add read-only MCP servers for extra context. |
| **Sub-agents** | **Managed Devins**: the primary session delegates sub-tasks to parallel Devin VMs. For maker/checker, run a separate **Devin Review** session over the diff — it reports `PASS/FAIL` without writing code. |
| **State / Memory** | **Knowledge base** (`Settings → Knowledge`): org-wide context (style guides, patterns). Supplement with a committed `STATE.md` at the repo root that every session reads first and updates at the end. |
| **PR-only writes** | Devin should open or update Pull Requests instead of committing directly to protected branches. All repository changes flow through PR review before merge — never push directly to `main`. |
| **Honest gaps** | No native cron-expression UI; no CLI worktree command (VM isolation is implicit); PR merge always requires a human — Devin cannot auto-merge. |

### Minimal Transfer Recipe

```bash
# 1. Create a Playbook from the loop-triage skill text
#    Settings → Playbooks → New Playbook

# 2. Seed project state
cp starters/minimal-loop/STATE.md.example STATE.md

# 3. Add project context to the Knowledge base
#    Settings → Knowledge → New Entry (paste AGENTS.md + codebase conventions)

# 4. Schedule a daily triage session
#    Settings → Schedules → New Schedule  (see prompt below)
```

### Week-one Daily Triage (Report-Only, L1)

```text
Run loop-triage for this repository.

1. Read STATE.md and the Knowledge base entries for this project.
2. Scan open issues and PRs for High Priority and Watch List items.
3. Update STATE.md with those sections only.
4. Do NOT edit source code, open PRs, or commit any file other than STATE.md.
5. Post a brief summary to the session chat for human review.
```

Graduate to L2 by adding PR creation to the Playbook — but always with a human gate:

> **Human Gate (L2+):** Devin PRs must be reviewed and merged by a human.
> Never enable auto-merge. Use Devin Review as the maker; a team member is the checker.
> Paths on the [denylist](../docs/safety.md#path-denylist) (secrets, billing, auth) require
> explicit human approval before any Devin session may touch them.
