# loop-sandbox

Ephemeral worktree isolation for Loop Engineering. Divert agent execution into an isolated git worktree, capture their changes as a reviewable `.patch` file, and instantly destroy the sandbox.

## Why loop-sandbox?

Unattended AI agents (loops) running directly in your main working tree can cause damage, overwrite untracked files, or make it incredibly tedious to untangle failed execution attempts.

`loop-sandbox` solves this by providing **ephemeral worktree isolation**:
1. It automatically creates an isolated git worktree for the agent to run in.
2. The agent runs its command, interacting with the codebase completely naturally.
3. When the command finishes, `loop-sandbox` automatically captures the agent's edits (including new untracked files) into a clean `.patch` file.
4. It nukes the worktree, keeping your main repo completely clean.

A human can then safely review the patch and apply it with one keystroke.

> [!WARNING]
> **Isolation Limits:** This is not a containerized air-gap. The agent process retains full filesystem and network access. It can escape the worktree (e.g. `../../`), and changes outside the worktree or to `.gitignored` files will **not** be captured in the patch. This tool is complementary to [docs/safety.md](../../docs/safety.md) and does not replace OS-level sandboxing for hostile code.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @cobusgreyling/loop-sandbox
# or run directly via npx
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-sandbox run -- <command>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Required Gitignores:** You must add the following to your project's `.gitignore` to prevent patches and worktree manifests from being committed:
> ```
> .loop-sandbox/
> .loop-worktrees/
> ```

## Usage

```bash
loop-sandbox <command> [options]
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `run [opts] -- <cmd>` | Run an agent command inside the isolated sandbox |
| `review` / `list` | List isolated patches ready for human review |

### Options for `run`

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--shell` | Forces `shell: true` (for `bash -c`, etc.). On Windows, npm-installed `.cmd` shims (`npx`, `tsc`, ...) that fail with `ENOENT` are automatically retried through a shell, so this is rarely needed there. |
| `--base <branch>` | The base branch for the worktree (defaults to current HEAD) |
| `--lock-paths <globs>` | Comma-separated globs to hold a [`loop-worktree`](../loop-worktree) advisory lock on for the run's duration, so a scheduled loop can't touch the same paths concurrently. Off by default -- see [Multi-loop safety](#multi-loop-safety) below. |
| `--lock-owner <name>` | Lock owner name (defaults to the run's generated id) |
| `--lock-ttl <dur>` | e.g. `30m` -- passed through to `loop-worktree`'s `--ttl` |
| `--lock-wait <dur>` | e.g. `5m` -- passed through to `loop-worktree`'s `--wait` |

### Examples

**Running a tool via an agent:**
```bash
# Safely let an agent run your linter/formatter without polluting your working tree
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-sandbox run -- npx my-agent
```

**Running a shell command:**
```bash
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-sandbox run --shell -- bash -c "echo 'hello' > test.txt"
```

**Running alongside a scheduled loop that touches the same files:**
```bash
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-sandbox run --lock-paths "src/**,docs/**" -- npx my-agent
```

**Reviewing and applying patches:**
```bash
# List all patches the sandbox caught
npx @cobusgreyling/loop-sandbox review

# Example output:
# === Loop Sandbox Patches ===
# 📄 sandbox-82f1e394.patch (1.2 KB)
#    Apply: git apply .loop-sandbox/patches/sandbox-82f1e394.patch
```

## How it works

Under the hood, `loop-sandbox` leverages `@cobusgreyling/loop-worktree` and native `git worktree` primitives. It creates a temporary branch from your current HEAD, spawns your process with its `cwd` set to the isolated tree, runs `git diff --cached` to generate the patch, and uses `git worktree remove --force` to clean up.

## Multi-loop safety

A sandbox run is not, by itself, protected against a scheduled loop editing
the same files at the same time -- `--lock-paths` opts a run into
`loop-worktree`'s advisory lock (acquired before the worktree is created,
released once the run finishes) so a colliding scheduled loop's own `lock`
call fails loudly instead of racing silently. See
[docs/multi-loop.md](../../docs/multi-loop.md) for the wider convention this
follows.
