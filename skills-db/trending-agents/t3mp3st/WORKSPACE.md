## AIWG Context Graph

This file is the canonical provider-neutral home for project and operator context.
Provider startup files are generated adapters: they direct the harness here first,
then to AIWG.md for framework discovery and routing.

### Precedence

1. Provider, system, and organization instructions retain their native authority.
2. Root WORKSPACE.md supplies shared project/operator context.
3. AIWG.md supplies generated framework/discovery context.
4. Narrower linked files and provider-native subtree instructions govern their declared scope.

### Ownership

- Edit project-neutral notes only inside the protected Project Context section below.
- Keep detailed policies, runbooks, hooks, and quickrefs in linked files.
- Keep provider-only directives in `.aiwg/context/providers/`.
- Never store secrets, tokens, credentials, or machine-local sensitive values here.

### Linked Context

- [AIWG framework context](./AIWG.md)
- [AIWG project configuration](.aiwg/aiwg.config)
- [Project-local quickref](.aiwg/quickref.json) (when configured)
