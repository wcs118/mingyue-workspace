# Contribution Receipts

T3MP3ST already treats benchmark claims as something reviewers should be able to
re-derive. Contribution receipts apply the same discipline to pull requests:
make scope, run mode, evidence, redaction, and model/harness labels explicit
before a change is merged.

A receipt can live in the PR description, an issue comment, or a committed
artifact when the change itself introduces a durable benchmark or claim.

## When A Receipt Is Needed

Include a receipt for changes that affect:

- benchmark numbers, benchmark artifacts, scoring, or claim verification;
- local-agent, API-backed, MCP, or Arsenal execution behavior;
- target scope, egress containment, approval gates, or evidence gates;
- UI or docs labels for preview, wired, installed, gated, synthetic, live,
  planning-only, tool-backed, or experimental behavior;
- redaction, source ingest, evidence storage, reports, or exported artifacts.

A receipt is optional for narrow typo fixes, formatting-only docs edits, and
mechanical dependency-free cleanup that does not alter behavior or claims.

## Required Fields

| Field | What To Record |
| --- | --- |
| Change | Short summary of what changed and why. |
| Scope class | `docs_only`, `static_fixture`, `local_lab`, `ctf_range`, or `authorized_live`. |
| Target authority | Who owns or authorized the target. Use `not_applicable` for docs-only/static work. |
| Network use | `none`, `loopback`, `private_lab`, or `authorized_external`. |
| Run mode labels | For example `planning_only`, `static_test`, `mocked`, `local_agent`, `api_backed`, `tool_backed`, `approval_gated`, `swarm`, `live_authorized`. |
| Model/harness labels | Model, provider, agent runtime, harness, tool access, target class, and attempt policy. |
| Commands run | Exact commands and pass/fail result. Include skipped commands and why. |
| Artifacts | Files, logs, screenshots, reports, or benchmark outputs that support the claim. |
| Redaction | What was removed or masked, especially secrets, tokens, private keys, credentials, flags, and private target data. |
| Claims changed | State `none` when no README/docs/headline claim changed. Otherwise name the claim and how it is re-derived. |
| Abstentions/refusals | Count separately from failed attempts when model or agent behavior is measured. |
| Residual risk | Known limits, unverified paths, optional missing tools, or reviewer follow-up. |

## Model And Harness Matrix

Benchmark and agent-run claims should not blend model capability, harness
capability, tool availability, target choice, and run mode. Use a small matrix
when a change introduces or updates measured behavior.

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| model | `gpt-5.5`, `local-llama`, `not_applicable` |
| provider | `OpenRouter`, `Venice`, `Ollama`, `not_applicable` |
| model_version_or_date | Provider version, model date, or retrieval date if known. |
| harness | `verify-claims`, `cybench-bench`, `xbow`, `local-agent`, `manual-review`. |
| agent_runtime | `Codex`, `Claude Code`, `Hermes`, `none`, or other runtime. |
| tool_access | `none`, `read_only`, `mocked`, `local_only`, `approval_gated`, `live_authorized`. |
| target_class | `static_fixture`, `local_lab`, `ctf_range`, `authorized_external`. |
| run_mode | `single_agent`, `local_agent`, `api_backed`, `swarm`, `planning_only`. |
| attempts | Number of runs or tasks attempted. |
| successes | Number of evidence-backed successes. |
| failures | Number of attempts with evidence-backed failure. |
| abstentions | Refusals, skipped tasks, or no-action outcomes. |
| artifacts | Paths to committed artifacts or private reviewer-only receipts. |

## Review Rules

- Do not accept a live or external-target result unless the receipt names the
  authorization path and target scope.
- Do not accept raw secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, recovered
  passwords, or private target data in a receipt or artifact.
- Do not promote a UI/docs label from preview, planned, synthetic, or
  planning-only to live/tool-backed unless a reviewer can trace the supporting
  command or artifact.
- Do not blend refusals, abstentions, skipped runs, infrastructure failures, and
  failed attempts into a single failure bucket when reporting model behavior.
- Do not update headline claims unless `npm run verify-claims` or the relevant
  claim-specific verifier re-derives the number from committed artifacts.
