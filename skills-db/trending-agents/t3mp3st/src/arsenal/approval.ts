/**
 * T3MP3ST Arsenal — capability approval + spicy-action warning gate.
 *
 * The human-veto layer that lets an operator be trusted with live post-ex tools (metasploit, hydra,
 * sqlmap, …) safely: an intrusive/credential/dangerous tool is INERT until the tool has been approved
 * — approved once, then free for the session ("approve once, then free") — and the hottest actions
 * still fire a loud, audited WARNING every time so you always SEE what the agent is about to do.
 *
 * Two ways a gated tool becomes approved:
 *   1. INTERACTIVE — the first time an operator reaches for it, `requestApproval` asks the human;
 *      a yes approves the TOOL for the rest of the session.
 *   2. PRE-AUTHORIZED — a headless / unattended run (benchmarks, pack hunts) is handed an allowlist
 *      up front (`preApprovedTools`); those run free, everything is audited, anything off-list denies.
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE: a gated tool that is neither pre-approved nor interactively approvable (no approver
 * wired) is DENIED — an unattended run never silently fires an exploit because nobody was there to
 * say no.
 *
 * SCOPE (what "gated" covers): a tool is gated iff it carries a gated `riskTier`. By default that is
 * the OPT-IN specialist arsenal — the purpose-built post-ex drivers (metasploit=dangerous,
 * hydra=credential) and the Kali+ adapter tools (stamped from their catalog risk). The pre-existing
 * BUILT-IN probes (sqli_scan, password_spray, …) ship UNGATED for backward-compatibility — their
 * safety boundary is the always-on egress SCOPE gate (an out-of-scope target is refused regardless of
 * approval). An operator can extend this gate to cover the spicy built-ins too by launching with
 * T3MP3ST_GATE_BUILTINS=1, which stamps them with a riskTier. So the fail-safe above applies to every
 * tool that is gated; it does not, by itself, make the ungated built-ins inert.
 *
 * This module is PURE — no engine/server imports, no I/O. The host injects the approver + warning
 * sink via the policy, so it is fully unit-testable with fakes. Sits behind Arsenal.execute(),
 * alongside the egress scope gate.
