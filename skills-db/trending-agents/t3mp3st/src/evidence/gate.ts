/**
 * The live verification gate — the honesty spine, IN the engine path.
 *
 * The disclosure-grade gates (scripts/verify-finding.mjs: anchors, poc ladder,
 * refuter panel, novelty) run on hand-authored finding JSON at the CLI. This is
 * their in-process counterpart for live, operator-produced findings: it refuses
 * to let a Finding be marked `verified` unless it is actually backed by real tool
 * output — provenance-strict, applied to the autonomous swarm, not beside it.
 *
 * The principle is the same one disclosure-gen enforces: a claim is only as strong
 * as its provenance. Prose is not evidence. A severity assertion with no evidence
 * is an overclaim. This is the door — not a decoration next to it.
