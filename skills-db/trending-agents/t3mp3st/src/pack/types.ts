/**
 * T3MP3ST Pack Hunt — shared-workspace types (Phase-2)
 *
 * The Pack Hunt is N specialized agents exploring ONE target in parallel, sharing a
 * live workspace (this board), posting leads, and claiming work so they don't re-tread.
 * See the pack-hunt design ("Shared workspace / lead-board" +
 * "Lead & work coordination").
 *
 * This file is the DATA layer only — pure types, no behavior. The `PackBoard` in
 * `./board.js` is an append-only event log that folds these into projections.
 *
 * Design constraints these types encode (all load-bearing per the red-team, §2):
 *  - A `Lead` is a lightweight *card*, NOT a vault Finding. It carries a foreign key
 *    (`where.targetId`) back to the provenance-gated `Finding.id` when one exists; the
 *    board never launders provenance itself (HT-1). `provenance` here is a plain flag.
 *  - `version` + `claim` exist so `claim()` can be a REAL synchronous compare-and-set
 *    (HT-1: "the claim-lock is advisory" → make it atomic).
 *  - `refutations` is append-only and NEVER unilaterally flips `status` (HT-2: a false
 *    refute must not permanently block re-finding a real bug).
