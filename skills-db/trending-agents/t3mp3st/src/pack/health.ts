// =============================================================================
// RATE-LIMIT / DEGRADED-HEALTH + LLM SEMAPHORE — Phase-0 pack-hunt safety primitive (HT-3)
// =============================================================================
// The exact cli-swarm lesson, ported into the engine path: N keyless local-agent operators share
// ONE subscription quota. Under a pack hunt they trip usage limits; several calls come back empty.
// If an empty/errored slot reads as "clean / found-nothing", the pack calls a rate-limited target
// CONVERGED. That is the failure this module exists to make impossible.
//
// Three pure, dependency-free primitives (no engine imports — safe to share everywhere):
//   1. isRateLimited(text)  — detect 429 / quota / usage-limit / rate-limit signatures.
//   2. DegradedTracker      — records ok/fail per local-agent call; a run where failures DOMINATE
//                             (>= 50%) verdicts INVALID_DEGRADED, NEVER a clean assessment.
//   3. Semaphore            — a correct bounded-concurrency async gate. A SINGLE GLOBAL instance
//                             (localAgentSemaphore) caps ALL local-agent calls across the pack, so
//                             8 operators behind one quota don't self-DoS into rate-limit hell.
//
// Ported verbatim from scripts/cli-swarm.mjs:
//   - the isRateLimited regex (cli-swarm.mjs:54-56).
//   - the degraded rule `backendFails / backendCalls >= 0.5 => INVALID_DEGRADED` (cli-swarm.mjs:355-358).
// =============================================================================

/**
 * True when `text` carries a rate-limit / quota-exhaustion / usage-limit / overload signature. A
 * local-agent call that hits its subscription quota returns an ERROR STRING, not findings — surface
 * it so the slot is flagged degraded and can NEVER be mistaken for a clean "found nothing".
 *
 * Broadened past cli-swarm's original (which missed Anthropic 529/"overloaded", Bedrock
 * "TooManyRequestsException", gRPC/Vertex "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED", bare "throttled", and reversed
 * "exceeded your quota" phrasings) so a throttled reply can't slip through as a clean result. The
 * fail-safe direction is to OVER-flag degraded — a false positive just re-runs a slot; a false
 * negative books a rate-limited body as a clean assessment, the exact bug this guards.
 *
 * Word/phrase signatures fire anywhere; the numeric HTTP status codes (429/503/529) fire ONLY when
 * they read as a status/error, so a bare integer in benign output ("line 429", "CWE-529",
 * "4290 findings") does not false-positive.
 *
 * Signatures are provider ERROR-ENVELOPE tokens, NOT the bare English a security finding uses. In a
 * pack hunt the local-agent's own result body legitimately describes rate-limit / DoS vulnerabilities
 * ("rate limiting is MISSING on /login", "no rate-limit on password reset", "CWE-400 … service
 * unavailable", "slow down attacker", "concurrent request bug") — those must read as FINDINGS, not as a
 * throttled slot (adversarial review, 7th pass). So the ambiguous bare phrases were dropped: a limit
 * being HIT is matched ("rate limit exceeded/reached/hit", past-tense "rate-limited"), while a finding
 * that a limit is ABSENT is not. Genuine 503/"service unavailable" throttles are still caught via the
 * numeric HTTP-status regex.
