// Coverage-only configuration. Test discovery, environment, and everything else
// stay on Vitest defaults — this file exists solely to enforce the multi-language
// ingest quality gate: 100% coverage (statements/branches/functions/lines) on the
// three fully-new source files this feature adds.
//
// Edited files (code-ingest.ts, whitebox.ts, server.ts) are NOT in `include`: a
// whole-file 100% threshold is unachievable on large pre-existing files, and the
// gate for them is "new branches covered", verified by the multilang/regression
// suites rather than a file-level threshold. The single server.ts bootstrap line
// (`await initGrammars()`) is the documented carve-out — smoke-covered, and
// initGrammars itself is unit-tested to 100% in ts-grammars.test.ts.
