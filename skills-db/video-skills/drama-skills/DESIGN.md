# Short Drama Creator Workspace Design

## Status

- **Status:** Active
- **Last refreshed:** 2026-08-06
- **Primary surface:** `$short-drama dashboard`
- **Audience:** writers, directors, and independent short-drama creators

## Product principle

Creators work on one page:

```text
项目标题与状态
内容目录 | 当前正文
待办提示与导出提示
```

The product has one page and one always-visible reading area. It does not provide tabs,
pop-up document viewers, an advanced mode,
engineering mode, raw-file view, lifecycle panel, or technical report entry.
Runtime records and integrity evidence remain system-owned and have no product
navigation.

## Goals

- Answer within ten seconds: which project, which episode, current work, next action.
- Organize work by project, episode, scene, character, and shot instead of files.
- Let creators read and edit story content without understanding its storage format.
- Keep version choice explicit: saving text never means adopting a creative version.
- Explain problems in terms of audience or production impact.
- Export production materials by purpose.

## Single-page information architecture

```text
短剧创作台
├── 当前项目与一句状态说明
├── 内容目录
│   ├── 全剧
│   └── EP001
│       ├── 故事与剧本
│       ├── 人物场景
│       ├── 分镜画面
│       └── 生成文案
├── 当前正文（始终可见，打开项目后自动载入）
└── 待办提示 / 导出提示
```

The interface never uses a filesystem tree as navigation. Markdown, structured
records, images, and video are rendered as creator-facing documents, cards, or
media previews in the permanent reading area. Selecting another item replaces that
area in place; it never opens a modal or another page.

### Creator-facing states

Use only these creator-facing states:

- 待你确认
- 需要修改
- 需要更新
- 已采用

The page shows only a compact plain-language reminder. Until creator-safe action APIs
exist, adoption feedback and export requests are handed back to the conversation; the
Dashboard must not imitate an action it cannot complete.

## Interaction rules

### Save

- Save persists the current edit.
- The interface shows saved, saving, unsaved, and conflict states in plain language.
- Save does not adopt the content as the chosen creative version.

### Adopt or return

- The Dashboard does not pretend that saving adopts a version.
- Pending work is read in place; the creator gives the decision in the conversation.
- A future action API may shorten this loop, but it must not add a second mode or page.

### Problems

Problem cards contain:

1. the scene or shot;
2. the audience or production impact;
3. the intended result;
4. a direct action.

Do not display internal severity names, reviewer identities, storage paths, or protocol
states.

## Visual language

- A calm director's worktable, not an administration dashboard.
- Graphite background with warm paper-like content surfaces.
- Amber marks the current action; red is reserved for required fixes; green is reserved
  for creator-confirmed or export-ready content.
- System sans-serif for controls and a readable local serif stack for screenplay content.
- Use the content rail and paper-like reading area as the defining visual motif.
- Avoid metric-card walls, decorative gradients, and code-editor styling.

## Accessibility and responsive behavior

- Native buttons, labels, headings, and live status regions.
- Visible keyboard focus and Cmd/Ctrl+S support.
- No state depends on color alone.
- Desktop uses a compact content rail plus one permanent content canvas.
- Narrow layouts stack navigation and content with 44px touch targets.
- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Creator-visible files

The target public handoff is:

```text
项目/
├── 原始资料/
├── 创作内容/
│   ├── 项目设定/
│   └── 剧集/
│       └── EP001/
│           ├── 剧本.md
│           ├── 视觉设定.md
│           ├── 分镜.md
│           ├── 图片提示词.md
│           └── 视频提示词.md
└── 导出/
```

Existing projects remain readable while storage migration is introduced safely. The
Dashboard must already present the simplified creator model even when an older project
still uses the existing internal layout.

## Implementation constraints

- Python standard-library server and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; no new dependency.
- Loopback-only session, Host/Origin validation, path containment, symlink refusal,
  atomic save, and concurrent-edit protection remain mandatory.
- Never inject project HTML into the DOM.
- The browser submits creator actions and content identifiers; it does not submit hashes,
  manifests, or arbitrary output paths.
- Every server action needs unit and HTTP coverage.
- Every visual change needs desktop and narrow-layout inspection.

## Delivery sequence

1. Replace the file console with the single creator workspace.
2. Add creator-safe adopt, return, problem, and export actions.
3. Introduce logical content identifiers independent of storage paths.
4. Migrate new projects to the simplified public directory and keep old projects readable.
